## Bias Assessment Framework

### Traditional vs. Modern Balance Score (0-100 scale)

#### Methodology Bias Assessment
- **Frequency Distribution**: Count traditional vs. modern approach mentions
- **Emphasis Analysis**: Evaluate depth of coverage for each approach
- **Example Balance**: Assess real-world vs. academic examples
- **Tool Diversity**: Measure breadth of platform coverage

#### Critical Bias Areas Identified

**Statistical Methods Bias (Current Score: 75/100 traditional bias)**
- Over-emphasis on frequentist approaches
- Insufficient Bayesian method coverage
- Limited modern computational statistics
- Recommendation: 50/50 balance target

**Tool Selection Bias (Current Score: 65/100 Python bias)**
- Python ecosystem dominance
- Limited R and other language coverage
- Cloud platform under-representation
- Recommendation: Multi-platform approach

**Implementation Context Bias (Current Score: 45/100 traditional bias)**
- Academic examples over real-world
- Limited enterprise-scale scenarios
- Insufficient DoD-specific context
- Recommendation: 70% real-world examples
