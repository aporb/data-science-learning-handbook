## üéØ Purpose

This handbook bridges the gap between academic theory and production-ready data science. Each section provides:

- **Rigorous validation** through current technical documentation and real-world testing
- **Bias assessment** to identify methodological limitations and cultural perspectives
- **Practical examples** from government, enterprise, and research contexts
- **Platform-specific guidance** for Advana, Qlik, Databricks, and Navy Jupiter environments

## üöÄ Quick Start

### For Data Scientists
1. Start with [Section 01](docs/01_Introduction.md) for foundational concepts
2. Jump to [Section 06](docs/06_Supervised_Machine_Learning.md) for ML techniques
3. Review [Section 12](docs/12_Ethics_Privacy_Governance.md) for responsible AI practices

### For Data Engineers
1. Begin with [Section 10](docs/10_Data_Engineering_and_Pipelines.md) for ETL workflows
2. Explore [Section 11](docs/11_Model_Evaluation_Deployment_Monitoring.md) for MLOps
3. Check platform-specific sections for Advana/Databricks integration

### For Analysts
1. Focus on [Section 04](docs/04_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.md) for EDA techniques
2. Use [Section 05](docs/05_Statistical_Inference.md) for rigorous statistical methods
3. Leverage [Section 08](docs/08_Time_Series_Analysis.md) for forecasting

### For Government/DoD Personnel
1. Review platform-specific guidance throughout
2. Pay special attention to [Section 12](docs/12_Ethics_Privacy_Governance.md) for compliance
3. Use [Section 13](docs/13_Appendices.md) for quick reference and tools
